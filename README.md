# Shell-Programming

**Hi, this code is a 42sh with builtins and other stuff**

*Builtins*
    => alias, cd, echo, env, exit, repeat, setenv, unsetenv, where
    => semicolons (';'), pipes ('|'), redirections ('<', '<<', '>', '>>')

You can test this program by executing the tester.sh
```
$> make -j
$> ./tester.sh
```

Enjoy !
